## Scrum log

Daily scrum is at 9:30 AM. Attach your update as a THREAD to this message. Each team should answer 3 questions: What did you do yesterday? What are your plans for today and Do you have any blockers? Thanks!

### Project
An instagram clone made with node, express, mongodb and React.

### Tuesday
**What I did**: Set up development enviornment. Completed simple server side CRUD functionality for posts. Authentication with json web tokens. Began React for client side.

**What I plan to do**: Incorporate react router into project. Add more data models than just users and posts. Consider weather or not to learn Redux for state management or complete project with what I know.

**What were the challenges**: I'm extremely lazy so without a group to hold me accountable has proven to be a challenge on it's own.
